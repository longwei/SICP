NP-Completeness
Ubiquitous Intractablitity
what should I do when I have a npc problem?

polynomial-time solvability
o(n^k)

The class P: 
the set of poly-time solvable problems
1. cycle-free shorest paths in graphs with negative cycles
2. knapsack

The traveling salesman problems (MST)
Input, complete undirected graph with non-negative edge costs

Reductions, TSP as hard as other problems
Halting problem
